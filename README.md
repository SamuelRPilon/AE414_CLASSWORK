# Space Propulsion Class Work

This repository contains all of the code that I wrote for my Space Propulsion class. During the class, we learned about the fundamental principles of space propulsion and how they are used to design and build spacecraft engines that can operate in the harsh environment of space.

The code in this repository covers a wide range of topics related to space propulsion, including:

- Rocket propulsion systems
- Electric propulsion systems
- Plasma physics
- Thermodynamics
- Fluid dynamics

In each folder, you will find code examples and exercises that I completed throughout the course. Some of the highlights of the repository include:

- **Rocket Propulsion Systems**: In this section, I wrote code to simulate the performance of a rocket engine using the ideal rocket equation and the rocket thrust equation. I also wrote code to optimize the engine design parameters, such as the nozzle area ratio, to maximize the specific impulse.

- **Electric Propulsion Systems**: In this section, I wrote code to model the performance of electric thrusters, such as Hall thrusters and ion thrusters. I used numerical methods to solve the equations of motion for the charged particles and the electric and magnetic fields, and I compared the results to experimental data.

- **Plasma Physics**: In this section, I wrote code to simulate the behavior of plasmas in a variety of settings, including magnetized plasmas, dusty plasmas, and laser-plasma interactions. I used numerical methods to solve the equations of motion for the charged particles and the electric and magnetic fields.

Overall, this repository provides a comprehensive collection of code examples and exercises that demonstrate the principles and applications of space propulsion. I hope that it will be a useful resource for anyone interested in learning more about this exciting field of study.
